# Finite-State-Machine-FSM-Sequence-Detector
This project implements a Finite State Machine (FSM) in Verilog to detect a specific sequence (1101) on an input data stream. The FSM asserts an output signal (start_shifting) when the sequence is detected. This design includes state transitions, synchronous reset functionality, and is verified using a testbench.
